# CapyBaby

CapyBaby is a survival game where the player has to stay alive on a raft as long as possible. The raft is set up as a 7x7 grid, and at set increments, random tiles will shake. The player will then have to get to a non-shaking square fast enough before the tile drops. As the game progresses, the amount of tiles that fall increases until only one tile remains. Each time a player survives a wave of tiles falling, 100 points is added to his/her score.

## Functionality & MVP

In CapyBaby, users will be able to:

 - Move the player in cardinal directions using keyboard arrow keys
 - See which tiles will be falling with a flashing animation
 - Fall into the water if they don't get onto a safe tile in time
 - Check their score in the corner of the screen

In addition, this project will include:

 - A pop up instruction menu on the landing page
 - Fruit spawning on the raft for the player to collect and score extra points
