# CapyBaby Is Late for School!

## Background

CapyBaby is a survival game where the player has to help CapyBaby stay afloat on the raft taking him to school. At fixed increments, segments of the raft will collapse and CapyBaby must avoid the dangerous areas to get to class before the bell rings.

Enjoy!

In addition, this project will include:
